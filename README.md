# UiPath - Excel Read & Write Workflow

This repository contains a simple **UiPath workflow** that demonstrates:
- Reading data from an **Excel file**
- Writing data into another **Excel file**

---

## Project Overview
- Built using **UiPath Studio**
- Demonstrates usage of **Excel Application Scope**, **Read Range**, and **Write Range**
- A basic learning project for working with Excel files in UiPath

---

## Project Files
- `Main.xaml` â†’ The main workflow file
- `InputData.xlsx` â†’ Sample Excel file with data to read
- `OutputData.xlsx` â†’ Excel file where data is written
- `project.json` â†’ Project configuration
- `.screenshots/` â†’ Auto-generated by UiPath (if any)

### ðŸ”¹ Read Data
- Opens **InputData.xlsx**
- Reads data from `Sheet1`
- Stores it in a **DataTable** variable (`dtInput`)

### ðŸ”¹ Write Data
- Opens **OutputData.xlsx**
- Writes the stored DataTable to `Sheet1` starting from `A1`
- Includes column headers
